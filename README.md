## About Me
Hi! I'm Andrew, a developer born and raised in Hong Kong.

I enjoy creating beautiful, simple and elegant things. I used to develop modern web applications under Agile methodology. I’ve mostly worked with JavaScript, React and PHP but also a little bit with Node.js and Golang. 

In my free time, I [do mobile apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/man-chun-mok/id1350308720), [write a blog](https://medium.com/@andrewmmc) and [take photography](https://vsco.co/andrewmmc).

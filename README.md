## About Me
ðŸ‘‹! I'm Andrew, a sofware developer based in Hong Kong.

I enjoy creating beautiful, simple and elegant things. I used to develop modern web applications under Agile and Waterfall methodologies with Git workflow. Iâ€™ve mostly worked with TypeScript, React, Node.js and PHP but also a little bit with Golang. 

In my free time, I [do mobile apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/man-chun-mok/id1350308720), [write a blog](https://andrewmmc.com) and [take photography](https://vsco.co/andrewmmc).
